## Startup Instructions

To run this project, first ensure that you have Node installed, and are using a version greater than 10.2. I use 12.18.3. Clone the repository down to your local device, cd into the new directory, and run yarn install. Once you have downloaded all the necessary packages, you can run yarn start, and view the project in a browser at http://localhost:3000/. Enjoy!

## Description

This application is a basic trivia game with a landing page, main page, and completion page. A user first navigates to the main game page and is greeted by two main components. The first is a sidebar, which is used mostly to navigate between questions. The second is the question display area, which contains the current question, the choices, which are randomly shuffled to avoid cheating, and a submit button which can be used to actually submit a choice for a question. Users cannot answer questions more than once. After all questions have been completed, users can submit their quiz and they will be show a completion screen. From there, they are able to start the quiz again if they wish to do so.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
